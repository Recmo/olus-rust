# Chapter 1: Why

Oluś is a toy/experimental language that is focused on

* questioning orthodoxy,
* extreme minimalism, and
* expressiveness

In particular it is the first language to exclusively use 'continuation passing style' (CPS). CPS is much used as an interal language in functional language compilers, and support for it exists in most lanugages, but Oluś is the first language designed to exclusively use CPS. This has a number of interesting consequences to the language and compiler design.

There are many new languages out there, but most of them are small variations of the same theme. They all combine aspects of imperative (C like) and 

**Questioning orthodoxy.**

**Extreme minimalism.** Like Lisp, Forth and Metamath. A fully functional interpreter can be written in few lines of code.

**Expressiveness.**
